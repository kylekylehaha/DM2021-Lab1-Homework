    "1. First: do the **take home** exercises in the [DM2021-Lab1-master Repo](https://github.com/fhcalderon87/DM2021-Lab1-master). You may need to copy some cells from the Lab notebook to this notebook. __This part is worth 20% of your grade.__\n",

    "2. Second: follow the same process from the [DM2021-Lab1-master Repo](https://github.com/fhcalderon87/DM2021-Lab1-master) on **the new dataset**. You don't need to explain all details as we did (some **minimal comments** explaining your code are useful though).  __This part is worth 30% of your grade.__\n",
    "    - Download the [the new dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Sentiment+Labelled+Sentences#). The dataset contains a `sentence` and `score` label. Read the specificiations of the dataset for details. \n",
    "    - You are allowed to use and modify the `helper` functions in the folder of the first lab session (notice they may need modification) or create your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Third: please attempt the following tasks on **the new dataset**. __This part is worth 30% of your grade.__\n",
    "    - Generate meaningful **new data visualizations**. Refer to online resources and the Data Mining textbook for inspiration and ideas. \n",
    "    - Generate **TF-IDF features** from the tokens of each text. This will generating a document matrix, however, the weights will be computed differently (using the TF-IDF value of each word per document as opposed to the word frequency). Refer to this Sciki-learn [guide](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html) .\n",
    "    - Implement a simple **Naive Bayes classifier** that automatically classifies the records into their categories. Use both the TF-IDF features and word frequency features to build two seperate classifiers. Comment on the differences.  Refer to this [article](https://hub.packtpub.com/implementing-3-naive-bayes-classifiers-in-scikit-learn/).\n",

    "4. Fourth: In the lab, we applied each step really quickly just to illustrate how to work with your dataset. There are somethings that are not ideal or the most efficient/meaningful. Each dataset can be habdled differently as well. What are those inefficent parts you noticed? How can you improve the Data preprocessing for these specific datasets? __This part is worth 10% of your grade.__\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Fifth: It's hard for us to follow if your code is messy :'(, so please **tidy up your notebook** and **add minimal comments where needed**. __This part is worth 10% of your grade.__\n",
